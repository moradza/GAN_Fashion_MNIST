    "Here, a generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. Objective of the GAN is to generate new fashion clothes.\n",
    "GANs were developed by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014 ([see](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)).\n",
    "GANs relies on the idea to have two networks, a generator $G$ and a discrimininator $D$, competing agiant each other. While $G$ tries to create fake data, the discriminator task is to determine whether the data passed to it is drawn from real data or it is generated by $G$. It is, in fact, similar to a two-party game, in which $G$ and $D$ are improving their performance throguh competition between each other. The value function for GAN can be written as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\min \\max V(D, G) = \\mathrm{E}_{x\\sim p_{data(x)}} [\\log D(x)] + \\mathrm{E}_{z\\sim p_z(z)} [ \\log (1-D(G(z))]$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind GANs is that you have two networks, a generator $G$ and a discriminator $D$, competing against each other. The generator makes fake data to pass to the discriminator. The discriminator also sees real data and predicts if the data it's received is real or fake. The generator is trained to fool the discriminator, it wants to output data that looks _as close as possible_ to real data. And the discriminator is trained to figure out which data is real and which is fake. What ends up happening is that the generator learns to make data that is indistiguishable from real data to the discriminator.\n",

    "The general structure of a GAN is shown in the diagram above, using Fashion-MNIST images as data. The latent sample is a random vector the generator uses to contruct it's fake images. As the generator learns through training, it figures out how to map these random vectors to recognizable images that can foold the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the discriminator is a sigmoid function, where 0 indicates a fake image and 1 indicates an real image. If you're interested only in generating new images, you can throw out the discriminator after training. The code is written in TensorFlow."
